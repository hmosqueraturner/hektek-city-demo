# Release v3.3.0: Experience Control

**Date:** November 27, 2025
**Status:** Stable / Production Ready
**Codename:** "Experience Control"

## 🚀 Overview

Release v3.3.0 marks the completion of the "Experience Control" initiative. This major update transforms HEKTEK City from a passive 3D viewer into an interactive, user-driven experience. It introduces a centralized control system (`CockpitConsole`), a standalone 3D arcade for projects (`ProjectsConsole`), and a unified "Cyberpunk Glass" UI design language.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Centralized Cockpit Console
The new `CockpitConsole` replaces scattered UI elements with a unified operation hub at the bottom of the screen.
-   **Unified Controls:** Manage Tours, Themes, and Navigation from one place.
-   **Reactive Design:** The console dynamically adjusts its size to fit active controls.
-   **Hero Action Button:** Context-aware button that changes function (Start Tour, Stop Tour, Enter Building) based on user state.
-   **Direct Theme Access:** Switch between Cyberpunk, Mars, Pandora, and Original themes instantly.

### 2. Projects Console (Sci-Fi Arcade)
A dedicated 3D environment for showcasing projects, accessible via `/projects`.
-   **Immersive Environment:** A standalone "Arcade" scene with neon lighting, bloom effects, and reflective surfaces.
-   **Arcade Machines:** 3D representations of projects (powered by R2 assets).
-   **Performance:** Runs on an isolated Canvas for maximum visual fidelity without impacting the main city map.

### 3. Cyberpunk Glass UI System
A complete overhaul of the user interface to match the high-tech aesthetic.
-   **Visual Language:** Glassmorphism, neon borders (`#00F0FF`, `#BB1111`), and `Michroma` typography.
-   **CreativeIcons:** A custom library of animated SVG icons (Orbit, AI Brain, Rocket, etc.).
-   **Consistency:** Applied across the Cockpit, Blog, About Me, and Projects views.

### 4. Enhanced Navigation
-   **Guided Tours:** Automated cinematic tours of the city.
-   **Smart Routing:** Seamless transitions between the City Map and sub-scenes (Projects, Blog).
-   **"Return to Orbit":** A standardized navigation pattern to return to the global view.

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements

-   **Architecture:** Decoupled `ProjectsConsole` from the main `MapRPG` for better resource management.
-   **Asset Pipeline:** Unified `assetsHelper.js` to serve assets from Cloudflare R2 for both the main map and sub-scenes.
-   **Performance:** Optimized React rendering with `fit-content` layouts and reduced re-renders in the HUD.
-   **Cleanup:** Removed legacy components (`MapControlsPanel`, `ContactFooter`) to reduce technical debt.
