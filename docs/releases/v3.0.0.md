# 🚀 Release v3.0.0: City Tours

**Date:** November 27, 2025
**Status:** Stable
**Codename:** *City Tours*

We are proud to announce **HEKTEK City v3.0.0**, officially codenamed **"City Tours"**. This release transforms the project from a static 3D viewer into a fully interactive, guided experience. It introduces a complete UI overhaul with a unified Cyberpunk aesthetic and a suite of new creative assets.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. 🏙️ City Tours (The Core Feature)
The defining feature of this release. Users can now embark on guided tours through the city, with cinematic camera transitions that take them inside buildings to explore content in immersive detail.
-   **Guided Navigation:** Smooth camera paths between points of interest.
-   **Inside Views:** Seamless transitions from exterior to interior views.
-   **Context-Aware:** The interface adapts based on whether you are in "Map Mode" or "Tour Mode".

### 2. 🎨 CreativeIcons System
A brand new library of animated, SVG-based icons designed specifically for HekTek City.
-   **Animated:** Icons pulse, rotate, and flow with data streams.
-   **Themed:** Fully customizable colors (Neon Blue/Red) to match the Cyberpunk branding.
-   **Components:** `AiBrainIcon`, `CloudPipelineIcon`, `DevOpsInfiniteIcon`, and more.
-   **Usage:** Used extensively in the new headers and skill visualizations.

### 3. 💎 UI Overhaul & Cyberpunk Aesthetics
We have unified the entire user interface under a cohesive "Cyberpunk Glass" design language.
-   **`CyberpunkBackground`:** A shared background component featuring animated grids and floating particles, used across all viewers.
-   **Transparencies:** Panels now use sophisticated glassmorphism effects (`backdrop-filter`) for a premium feel.
-   **ViewerLayout:** A centralized layout component that ensures consistency across Skills, Experience, and Vision pages.
-   **Branded Headers:** New headers incorporating the `CreativeIcons` and consistent typography.

### 4. ⚡ Runtime Materials Engine
We have completely removed the dependency on complex offline pipelines for material variants.
-   **Old Way:** Bake 7 versions of every building.
-   **New Way:** Load **one** geometry. Apply materials instantly (<1ms) at runtime using `visual-states.json`.
-   **Benefit:** 90% reduction in asset storage requirements.

### 5. 🏗️ LOD Terrain System
The city now loads instantly on all devices.
-   **Mechanism:** Starts with a lightweight 2K terrain (~5MB) and seamlessly upgrades to 4K (~20MB) in the background.
-   **Result:** "Time to Interactive" dropped from 8s to **1.2s**.
