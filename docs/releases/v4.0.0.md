# Release v4.0.0: "Imoto"

**Date:** November 28, 2025
**Status:** Stable / Production Ready
**Codename:** "Imoto"

## 🚀 Overview

Release v4.0.0, codenamed **"Imoto"**, represents the culmination of the "Experience Control" initiative and the full public launch of HEKTEK City. This release solidifies the transition from a static 3D viewer to a fully interactive, gamified platform.

It brings together the centralized **Cockpit Console**, the immersive **Projects Arcade**, and a robust **Cloud-Native Architecture** powered by Cloudflare R2.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. The Cockpit Console (Centralized Control)
The heart of the user experience. A unified, reactive control hub that manages:
-   **Navigation:** Instant jumps to key buildings (Skills, Experience, Vision).
-   **Themes:** One-click switching between 7 distinct environments.
-   **Tours:** Guided cinematic journeys through the city.
-   **Settings:** Audio and graphics controls.

### 2. Projects Arcade (Immersive Showcase)
A dedicated, high-fidelity 3D environment for exploring projects.
-   **Visuals:** Neon-drenched sci-fi arcade aesthetic with bloom and reflections.
-   **Interactivity:** 3D arcade machines representing individual projects.
-   **Isolation:** Runs on a separate scene graph for maximum performance.

### 3. Cloud-Native Asset Pipeline
-   **Cloudflare R2:** All 3D models, textures, and configurations are now served from the edge.
-   **Hybrid Config:** `useRemoteConfig` hook allows for seamless switching between local dev data and remote production data.
-   **Zero-Downtime Updates:** Content can be updated via JSON on R2 without redeploying the application.

### 4. Guided Tours & Camera System
-   **Cinematic Tours:** Automated camera paths that guide users through the portfolio narrative.
-   **"Inside" Views:** Seamless transitions from exterior views to interior content viewers.
-   **Smart Camera:** Physics-based controls with collision avoidance and smooth damping.

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements

-   **React 19 & Vite 7:** Upgraded core stack for latest performance features.
-   **Architecture:** Strict separation of concerns between `MapRPG` (City) and `ProjectsConsole` (Arcade).
-   **Performance:** Significant reduction in main thread blocking during scene transitions.
-   **Stability:** Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for network assets.
