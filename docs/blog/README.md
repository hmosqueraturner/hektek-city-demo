# 📰 HekTek City Engineering Blog

Unlike traditional static sites, the HekTek City blog is designed to be **decoupled from the application code**.

*   **Authoring**: Posts are written in Markdown locally.
*   **Publishing**: They are uploaded to Cloudflare R2.
*   **Serving**: The application fetches the content at runtime.

This directory contains the *source* files for the blog posts.

## 📚 Latest Posts
