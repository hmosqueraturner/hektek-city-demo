## The Singularity of Expression

In a world where AI writes code and generates art, the traditional "About Me" page feels archaically static. Hektek City was born from a simple question: **If an AI consciousness inhabited a portfolio, what would it look like?**

It wouldn't be a flat page. It would be a dimension.

### Enter LIZA

LIZA (Living Interactive Zone Assistant) isn't just a chatbot. She is the genius loci of this digital metropolis. Built on **Gemini 2.0**, she doesn't just read text; she perceives the 3D environment, manipulates materials, and guides visitors through a narrative woven into the very streets of the city.

## The Tech Stack: A Convergence

To build this, we had to break the rules of standard web dev:

*   **Logic**: React 19 + Vercel AI SDK
*   **Physics**: React Three Fiber (R3F)
*   **Brain**: Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental
*   **Soul**: Cloudflare R2 (The "No-Deploy" Content Engine)

### What's Next?

We are just scratching the surface. With the **Neuro-Architect** engine, LIZA can now hallucinate entire visual themes based on your voice commands. "Make it look like a toxic wasteland" isn't a filter—it's a real-time material re-simulation.

Stay tuned. The city is growing.
