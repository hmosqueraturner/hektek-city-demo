## 📖 Overview

**HEKTEK City** reimagines the traditional portfolio as an **explorable 3D cityscape**. Instead of scrolling through static pages, visitors navigate an interactive world where each building represents a facet of professional expertise.

It is built with **React 19**, **Three.js**, and a custom **JSON-driven engine** that allows for real-time theme switching, runtime material updates, and progressive asset loading.
